                        chocolate. PB
                        purists have been redeemed.
                        The <strong>Nasdaq</strong> plunged yesterday as Treasury yields ticked up.
                        Meanwhile,
                        <strong>Bitcoin</strong>
                        soared past $51K.
                        On the stimulus side: President Biden backed a plan to phase out direct payments at
                        lower income
                        levels. That would reduce the number of people who receive checks.

                        <strong>Google will stop using your individual browsing history to sell targeted ads</strong>
                    </h3>
                    <p>Cookie Monster goes on a diet... Google is Earth's biggest digital advertiser. In 2020, it
                        accounted for 52% of the world's digital ad spend (FYI: $292B). But it's making some privacy
                        changes that'll reduce its precious targeting abilities.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Last year,</strong> Google said it would remove third-party cookies from Chrome by
                            2022. These tiny pieces of data are widely used to track your individual browsing activity
                            from site to site.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><strong>Yesterday,</strong> Google said that it won't introduce new ways to track individual
                            browsing once cookies are gone.
                            <p><strong>That's the way the cookie crumbles....</strong>
                                Well, at least the third-party cookie. Google isn't scrapping first-party cookies, which
                                are meant to be used on the same domain they're placed on. They're why you don't need to
                                log in each time you open Gmail (cookie remembers). Google will still track your Search
                                history, and target ads/results there — same goes for YouTube. But when you visit
                                BuzzFeed, Google won't target ads based on your "organic cat food" search.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Google isn't getting rid of tracking:</strong>
                            That would kill its biz. Instead, it could use aggregated, anonymized tracking to target
                            without individual info. One of Google's solutions includes putting people into groups based
                            on similar browsing behaviors.
                        </li>

                    <p><strong>Google thinks the benefits outweigh the losses...</strong>and it could be right.
                        Individualized tracking has come under fire by regulators and privacy advocates. This could be a
                        move to get ahead of regulation — and win points with the public. Plus, Google's biz likely
                        won't take a major hit thanks to the alternatives it's cooking up: with group-based tracking,
                        Google says advertisers can expect at least 95% of the conversions per dollar spent (compared to
                        cookie-based advertising). Wall Street isn’t worried, either: Google shares fell only 1% more
                        than the market yesterday.</p>
